# Custom-Password-Generator-KD

## Description

A Javascript was created to generate a password from user inputs based off prompts and confirms. The password can have a length that ranges from 8-128 and can be comprised of upper case letters, lower case letters, special characters, and numbers. The password generator is set up with checks that will not allow the user to proceed with generating a password if the length is less than 8 or more than 128, and will not allow the user to proceed without selecting one choice of character.
